# My experience with ChatGPT
[‰∏≠Êñá](https://blog.hanqixu.com/%E5%88%9D%E8%A7%81ChatGPT/){: .btn }  
  
[**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/chat) has been flooded in my social media. It is an AI powered chatbot launched by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). The company who introduced [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) in 2021. As I always resist AI stuff and AI generate arts, I finally gave it a try.  
  
I was trying to sign up an email account on disroot.org for my Uptime Kuma notification. Disroot have a really interesting verification systems. They want me to write an 150 characters long sentence to determine that I am a bot or not.

As a lazy butt am I, and bad at English. I give ChatGPT a try. (sry Disroot employee, if you are reading this.. XD )  
 
I heard ChatGPT is somewhat powerful. Like in [@leo_song@mastodon.social](https://social.linux.pizza/@leo_song@mastodon.social)'s post: ![ChatGPT‰∏ç‰ºöÂÜôÊó•ËØ≠‰ø°‰ª∂ü§™](https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/109/498/484/132/432/281/original/b00e758c062acf64.png)  
  
Even tho it didn't say hi or ask how are your friend been, but the letter format is there, and it gives out Chinese translate.  
  
And in the Dec 23, 2022 [The Wan Show](https://youtu.be/TXsw_92Y2e0?t=3330)from LTT.  
(time stamp 0:55:30)  
Linus didn't recognize topics that were written in AI.  
  
It surprised Linus. But It didn't surprise me until I tried it myself.  
  
As my topic: "Being alone scares me the most"  
Here is what it gives me:

It is more like an essay or article, which it doesn't fit in this situation. So...

Now it looks more like a conversation. Still not what I'm looking for. Then I ask it to write it in first person.

Now it did the job I want it to do. It doesn't sound like me, but it did the job.  
  
I won't notice anything suspensories if this paragraph popped in a Discord chat. This is fluent and sound like human. A bit off-topic at the end, but overall pretty good.  
  
ChatGPT is a fantastic chatbot as right now. No chatbot can perform as near as good. It can translate, give advice and even write code.  
  
But right now, it is still a toy that trained on millions of articles, news and chat logs with no rights given. I agree to Linus on The Wan Show, the law should and need legislation about how they are training AIs. Technology is moving too fast to let law catch up. It will be a long way to go...  
  
So if I put the answer in there, is that mean I am a bot now?
