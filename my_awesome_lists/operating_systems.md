# Operating Systems
## Desktop Linux Distros
Here are desktop distros that I recommend for new users
### [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
The "just works" distro.  
If you start your Linux journey, this might be the best distro to try out. 

### [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
It's developed by [System76](https://system76.com/).  
I have used it for at least 2 years, super solid distro.  
Games run perfectly without much tweaking.  
Most of the problem on Ubuntu have fixed here. 

### [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/)
My favorite and my daily right now.  
If you want a nearly vanilla distro, Fedora is your choice. 

### [OpenSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/)
OpenSUSE Tumbleweed is a stable rolling release distro with the newish packages. YaST can be really easy for new users. 

## Server Linux Distros
### [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
You can't go wrong with Debian.  
It's known as the most stable community distro by running old packages. 

### [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/)
AlmaLinux is a community owned and governed enterprise Linux distribution.  
It is ABI compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

### [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/)
Rocky Linux is an enterprise operating system designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

### [OpenSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/)
OpenSUSE Leap uses source from SUSE Linux Enterprise, which gives a enterprise level of stability to your homelab. 

## Windows
### [Sophia Script for Windows](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows)  
This script allows you to delete bloatware, disable telemetry and more. 

[Here](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/2/29/Windows10.jpg) is why I prefer Linux.  
But, life isn't perfect. Sometimes we have to use Windows.  
We cannot get rid of every possible problems with Windows, but we can make it better.
