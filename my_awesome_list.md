# My Awesome List
[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) are lists of awesome tools, books, guides and media that everyone can contribute to. 

For example: 
- [List of Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [Awesome Broadcasting](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting)
- [Awesome Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/thibmaek/awesome-raspberry-pi)

So I thought, how about I made my own Awesome List. I have a lot of software tools I used every day, privacy focused or just good tools overall, mostly are open source. 

*This is not a formal Awesome List* Just so you know.

## Operating Systems
### Linux Distros
Here are Distros that I recommend for new users
[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
The "just works" distro.  
If you start your Linux journey, this might be the best distro to try out. 

[Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)  
It's developed by [System76](https://system76.com/).  
I have used it for at least 2 years, super solid distro.  
Games run perfectly without much tweaking.  
Most of the problem on Ubuntu have fixed here. 

[Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/)  
My favorite and my daily right now.  
If you want a nearly vanilla distro, Fedora is your choice. 

[OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)  
Server grade distro can be on your PC. YaST can be really easy for new users. 

### Windows
[Sophia Script for Windows](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows)  
This script allows you to delete bloatware, disable telemetry and more. 

[Here](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/2/29/Windows10.jpg) is why I prefer Linux.  
But, life isn't perfect. Sometimes we have to use Windows.  
We cannot get rid of every possible problems with Windows, but we can make it better. 


## Networking
### DNS
[Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/)  
Non-profit DNS resolver, promise for user privacy and protect user from malware and phishing. 

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)  
The self-host option for DNS, provide great ad blocking feature. 

### VPN & Proxy
[Mullvad](https://mullvad.net)  
Mullvad is a commercial VPN service based in Sweden. 

[Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/)  
Simple and fast modern self-hosted VPN.  

[Trojan](https://trojan-gfw.github.io/trojan/)  
An unidentifiable mechanism that helps you bypass GFW. 

[NekoRay](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/nekoray)  
Qt based cross-platform GUI proxy configuration manager. 

[NekoBox](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid)  
sing-box / universal proxy toolchain for Android. 


## Surfing on the web
### Web Browsers
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)  
The only non-Chromium based, open source web browser. 

[Brave](https://brave.com/)  
Zero configuration browser with Ad blocker build in.  
Apart from all the Web3 feature, it's a solid browser for someone that don't really want to mess with their browser. 

[ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)  
Vanilla Chromium but without all Google dependency.  

### Search Engines
[Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/)  
Independed search engine by Brave Software, Inc. 

[SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/)
Open source, self-hostable, privacy-respecting metasearch engine.  
It uses other search engine's result and combine them together.

It doesn't only block ads, also can [block YouTube short](https://letsblock.it/filters/youtube-shorts). 

[Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)  
Use your browser like you use Vim.
