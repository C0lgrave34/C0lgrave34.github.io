# My Awesome List
[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) are lists of awesome tools, books, guides and media that everyone can contribute to. 

For example: 
- [List of Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [Awesome Broadcasting](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting)
- [Awesome Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/thibmaek/awesome-raspberry-pi)

So I thought, how about I made my own Awesome List. I have a lot of software tools I used every day, privacy focused or just good tools overall, mostly are open source. 

*This is not a formal Awesome List* Just so you know.

# Operating Systems
## Linux Distros
Here are Distros that I recommend for new users
### [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
The "just works" distro.  
If you start your Linux journy, this might be the best distro to try out. 

### [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
It's developed by System76.  
I have used it for at least 2 years, super solet distro.  
Games run prefectly without much tweaking.  
Most of the problem on Ubuntu have fixed here. 

### [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/)
My favourite and my daily right now. 
If you want a nearly vanilla distro, Fedora is your choise. 

### [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
Server grade distro can be on your PC. YaST can be really easy for new users. 

## Windows
[Sophia Script for Windows](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows)  
This script allows you delete bloware, disable telemetry and more. 

[Here](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Windows_10) is why I prefer Linux.  
But, life isn't perfect. Sometime we have to use Windows.  
We cannot get rid of every possible problems with Windows, but we can make it better.
