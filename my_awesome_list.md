# My Awesome List
[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) are lists of awesome tools, books, guides and media that everyone can contribute to. 

For example: 
- [List of Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [Awesome Broadcasting](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting)
- [Awesome Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/thibmaek/awesome-raspberry-pi)

So I thought, how about I made my own Awesome List. I have a lot of software tools I used every day, privacy focused or just good tools overall, mostly are open source. 

*This is not a formal Awesome List* Just so you know.  
**This is still under construction**

# Operating Systems
## Linux Distros
Here are Distros that I recommend for new users
### [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
The "just works" distro.  
If you start your Linux journy, this might be the best distro to try out. 

### [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
It's developed by System76.  
I have used it for at least 2 years, super solet distro.  
Games run prefectly without much tweaking.  
Most of the problem on Ubuntu have fixed here. 

### [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/)
My favourite and my daily right now. 
If you want a nearly vanilla distro, Fedora is your choise. 

### [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
Server grade distro can be on your PC. YaST can be really easy for new users. 

## Windows
[Here](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Windows_10) is why I prefer Linux.  
But, life isn't perfect. Sometime we have to use Windows, either in school or work. 
We cannot get rid of every possible problems with Windows, but we can make it better.  
[Sophia Script for Windows](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows) allows you delete bloware, disable telemetry and more.
