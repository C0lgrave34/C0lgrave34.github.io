# My Awesome Lists
[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) are lists of awesome tools, books, guides and media that everyone can contribute to. 

For example: 
- [List of Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [List of Awesome Broadcasting](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting)
- [List of Awesome Mac softwares](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac)

So I thought, how about I made my own Awesome Lists. I have a lot of software tools I used every day, privacy focused or just good tools overall, mostly are open source. 

*These are not formal Awesome Lists* Just so you know.
