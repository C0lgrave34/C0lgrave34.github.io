*Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan*

I cannot hide my passions for cars, even on a tiring trip.

We went to Shibuya the last day we were in Tokyo. My goal, of course, is not shopping.  
I immediately started looking for cool cars.

It's late September, but it's still hot. It's hard not get sweaty.  
After an hour, it started to rain. It's not heavy, but enough to get yourself moist.

At least it helps with the heat.

A lot of people say that Japanese car culture died out.  
I don't think so.

I have seen so many Japanese people, the same age as me, in their early 20s, super passionate about cars.  
Strict laws, bad economy, even Covid didn't stop anyone. They are still holding on to this hobby, culture, whatever you want to call it.

I'm happy for it.  
And I'm grateful that I'm a part of it.
