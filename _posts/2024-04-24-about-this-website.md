I'm in my mid 20s, just graduated from college, and I already feel like there's too many things I need to take care of in my life.  
Life, health, things I love and home labs... (maybe I asked for it lol)  
2 days ago my Hugo website broke, headers and footers are gone, maybe from a theme update. So I thought combining the portfolio and blog together and just host on GitHub.  
After 2 days of looking for a good theme, I'm tired... too tired to care.  
So here we are, [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) by [riggraz](https://github.com/riggraz) 

# What about the old contents
The old contents are still on the site, clearly categorized and listed. We just don't have a search anymore. 

# Why Jekyll
After using Jekyll, Hugo's structure didn't make sense to me. I won't say It's hard to maintain, but I just don't like it anymore. 

# What happened to the old website
It disappeared, bombed, died. 

# Your website looks ugly now
Do I look like the type of guy who cares?  
The only thing you need to focus is the content. Nothing else.  

# Will the website stay like this? 
Maybe, maybe not. As a big tinker, this probably won't stay long, we will see.
