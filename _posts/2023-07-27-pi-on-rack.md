# Pi on Rack
Just like the name, this is a Raspberry Pi rack mount.

[Project Link](https://codeberg.org/Colgrave/pi-on-rack){: .btn .btn-outline }

## Why
There are project outthere like [russross's rack-mount bracket](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4125055). But that is a full rack, and I only have 1 raspi. 

At the same time, I would like to look clean and simple. 

## Solusion and Future plans
I only know a few things about Blender. And I used Boolean to out out the holes. 

This is not a ideal solusion. I would like to use a proper tools later on, such as OpenSCAD.  
It is not in development right now, but I still have plans for the future like dual mount and full 1U mount.
