# My Awesome List
[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) are lists of awesome tools, books, guides and media that everyone can contribute to. 

For example: 
- [List of Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [Awesome Broadcasting](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting)
- [Awesome Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/thibmaek/awesome-raspberry-pi)

So I thought, how about I made my own Awesome Lists. I have a lot of software tools I used every day, privacy focused or just good tools overall, mostly are open source. 

*These are not formal Awesome Lists* Just so you know.

# Operating Systems
## Desktop Linux Distros
Here are desktop distros that I recommend for new users

Games run perfectly without much tweaking.  
Most of the problem on Ubuntu have fixed here. 

### [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/)

This script allows you to delete bloatware, disable telemetry and more. 

[Here](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/images/2/29/Windows10.jpg) is why I prefer Linux.  
But, life isn't perfect. Sometimes we have to use Windows.  
We cannot get rid of every possible problems with Windows, but we can make it better. 


# Networking
## Router Firmaware
### [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/)
Put Linux on your old router and make it free and open!  
OpenWrt works better than the stock firmware from their vendor. It offers better stability and more features, such as VPN, DDNS and DNS over HTTPS. 

### [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/)
OPNsense is an open source, FreeBSD-based firewall and routing software forked from pfSense.  
It has newer packages and faster updates than pfSense. 

### [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/)

The only non-Chromium based, open source web browser. 

### [Brave](https://brave.com/)
Zero configuration browser with Ad blocker build in.  
Apart from all the Web3 feature, it's a solid browser for someone that don't really want to mess with their browser.

# Communications
## Realtime Communications
### [Signal](https://www.signal.org/)
Signal is an end-to-end encrypted messaging service.  
They were aiming for beating WhatsApp and fight for user privacy.  
Super user-friendly and only require phone number to sign up.  
Note: *Signal's server is not open source, but the client is.* 

### [Session](https://getsession.org/)
Session is an end-to-end encrypted, decentralized instant messaging application.  
It was originally started as a fork of Signal, but due to concerns about the centralized structure and phone number requirement, they decide to deviate from it.  
Compare to Signal, both all client and server software are open source. It uses a Session code to login, which might be confusion for some users. 

### [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) & [Element](https://element.io/)



## Email
### Email Provider
[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)

[Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail)

If non of that works for you, I'll say just use a email provider form a big corpration like: [Mail.com](https://www.mail.com/) Gmail or Outlook. 

### Email Client
